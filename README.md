### Challenge: Nodeis Write Stream 
In the JavaScript file, write a program to perform a GET request on the route https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/age-counting which 
contains a data key and the value is a string which contains items in the format: key=STRING, age=INTEGER. Your goal is to count how many 
items exist that have an age equal to 32. 
Then you should create a write stream to a file called output.txt and the contents should be the key values (from the json) each on a 
separate line in the order they appeared in the json file (the file should end with a newline character on its own line). 
Finally, then output the SHA hash of the file.
